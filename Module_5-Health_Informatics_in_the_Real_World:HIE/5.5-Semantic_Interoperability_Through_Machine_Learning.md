# 5.5 - Semantic Interoperability Through Machine Learning

## Context: Exploring Semantic Interoperability
- **Objective**: To discuss the role of machine learning in achieving semantic interoperability in healthcare data.

## Expert Perspective: Lloyd McKenzie
- **Credentials**: Internationally recognized expert in HL7 data modeling and adviser to Canada Health Infoway (similar to ONC in the US).
- **Viewpoint**:
    - "Really robust semantic interoperability is going to be dependent on machine learning and other technologies..."
    - Goal: Machines that can reason and infer context as well as humans.

## The Role of Machine Learning
- **Learning Through Data**: The effectiveness of machine learning comes from processing a large number of examples.
- **Data Types**: Could be pictures of cats, translated texts, or EHR notes about rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Digital Data Availability**: The explosion in machine learning is partly due to the availability of huge digital data sets.

## Challenges and Advantages
- **Consistency**: Internet data like cat photos are more consistent than EHR notes.
- **Privacy**: Unlike cat photos or translated texts, EHR notes are subject to privacy laws.

## The Big Question: Can Machines Take Over?
- **Semantic Interoperability**: With EHR adoption now widespread, is it best left to machines to figure out semantic interoperability?
- **Assumptions**: Assumes that lower levels of interoperability are solved and broader access to clinical data is available.

**Note**: This module points towards the future role machine learning could play in solving the challenges of semantic interoperability in healthcare data. It presents a viewpoint that machines could eventually process and reason through medical data as efficiently as humans, potentially revolutionizing how healthcare data is managed and utilized.
