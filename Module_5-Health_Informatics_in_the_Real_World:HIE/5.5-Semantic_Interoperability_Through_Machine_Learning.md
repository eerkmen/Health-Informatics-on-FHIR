# 5.5 - Semantic Interoperability Through Machine Learning

## Context: Exploring Semantic Interoperability
- **Objective**: To discuss the role of machine learning in achieving semantic interoperability in healthcare data.

## Expert Perspective: Lloyd McKenzie
- **Credentials**: Internationally recognized expert in HL7 data modeling and adviser to Canada Health Infoway (similar to ONC in the US).
- **Viewpoint**:
    - "Really robust semantic interoperability is going to be dependent on machine learning and other technologies..."
    - Goal: Machines that can reason and infer context as well as humans.
