# 5.4 - Applicadia Example

## Context: Real-world Application of Applicadia
- **Objective**: To provide an example of how Applicadia uses computational linguistics, in-memory graphs, and FHIR IDs to streamline EHR documentation.

## Behind the Scenes: Computational Linguistics and In-memory Graphs
- **Data Extraction**: Applicadia uses computational linguistics to extract key data points from the spoken statement.
- **In-memory Graph**: A hybrid of 20 different clinical ontologies woven together and made computable.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Achieved by matching to clinical models in the in-memory graph.

## Data Saving: FHIR IDs
- **ICD 10 Coding**: Prompts for more specificity to derive ICD 10 building code.
- **Data Saving**: Instead of saving the raw statement, Applicadia saves FHIR IDs into the electronic medical record.

## Intelligent Data Placement
- **Review of Systems**: Applicadia determines where in the medical record each bit of information should go based on what is extracted from it.
    - **Family History**: Patient's grandmother died of lung cancer 10 years ago, the patient had an appendectomy four years ago.
