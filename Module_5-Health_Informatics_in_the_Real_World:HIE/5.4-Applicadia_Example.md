# 5.4 - Applicadia Example

## Context: Real-world Application of Applicadia
- **Objective**: To provide an example of how Applicadia uses computational linguistics, in-memory graphs, and FHIR IDs to streamline EHR documentation.

## Behind the Scenes: Computational Linguistics and In-memory Graphs
- **Data Extraction**: Applicadia uses computational linguistics to extract key data points from the spoken statement.
- **In-memory Graph**: A hybrid of 20 different clinical ontologies woven together and made computable.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Achieved by matching to clinical models in the in-memory graph.
