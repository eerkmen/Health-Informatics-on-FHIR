# 5.2 - Clinical Information Modelling Initiative (CIMI)

## Introduction to Semantic Interoperability
- **Grahame Greive's Standpoint**: In 2013, Grahame Greive, the leader of global HL7's FHIR effort, mentioned, "Let's not pursue the holy grail right now."
- **Why FHIR Avoids Semantic Interoperability**: FHIR currently does not aim for semantic interoperability mainly due to the complexity it would add.

## Controversies Around Semantic Interoperability
- **Feasibility**: There are many strongly held opinions regarding the feasibility of semantic interoperability.
- **Different Approaches**: Multiple proposed methods exist for achieving semantic interoperability standards.

## Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI)
- **Mission**: Improve healthcare interoperability through shared, implementable clinical information models.
- **Ultimate Goal**: Achieve semantic interoperability.

## Challenges to Semantic Interoperability
- **Insufficiency of Data Exchange and Coding**: Simply sharing data and using coding systems are not sufficient to achieve semantic interoperability.
- **Variability in Codes**: For lab tests or clinical diagnoses, various coding systems exist that indicate different methods, interpretations, and levels of detail.
- **Provider Differences**: Healthcare providers can differ in how and when they use codes.

## Variability of Representation in EHR Systems
- **Example**: The concept of "suspected lung cancer" can be represented differently in three different EHR systems.
- **Implications**: Such variability makes it difficult to aggregate data for meaningful analysis or coordinated care.

## CIMIâ€™s Solution to Semantic Interoperability
- **Standard Structures**: Like HL7 messages, CIMI aims to have terms go in a consistent location.
- **Term Translation**: The aim is to translate terms into an agreed-upon standard.
