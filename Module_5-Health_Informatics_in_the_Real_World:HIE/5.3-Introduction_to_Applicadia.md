# 5.3 - Introduction to Applicadia

## Context: Innovative Approaches to Physician Charting
- **Connection to Semantic Interoperability**: Understanding semantic interoperability enables a better appreciation of EHR documentation developed by Applicadia.

## Introduction to Richard Esmond and Applicadia
- **Richard Esmond**: Chief Technical Officer of Applicadia and co-chair of the CIMI work group.
- **Video Contribution**: A short but conceptually rich video prepared by Richard Esmond.

## Core Feature: Clinical Concept Node Graph
- **Graph Focused Around Clinical Concept Nodes**: These nodes could be from SNOMED, ICD, LOINC, or RxNorm, or other health data standards.
- **Types of Nodes**:
  - Standard nodes from existing health data standards.
  - Synthetic knowledge elements parsed or analytically computed.
  - Nodes derived from clinical knowledge artifacts in CIMI models.

## Technological Capabilities of Applicadia
- **Voice Recognition for Medical Documentation**: Voice recognition tools to assist medical professionals.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used to categorize voice narration into traditional sections of a medical note.
- **Automatic Encoding of Free Text**: Converts free text notes into complex data standards such as SNOMED and ICD-10.
- **Mapping Voice Narrative to Clinical Concept Graphs**: Further use of NLP for semantic interoperability.
- **Guidance for Detailed Coding**: Helps in coding into the very detailed ICD-10 system.

## Practical Implications
- **Quality Metrics and Clinical Details**: Use of concept graph can guide physicians in reporting quality metrics and filling in missing clinical details.
- **Example**: Discussion of the history of present illness related to a patient's knee problem illustrates these capabilities.
