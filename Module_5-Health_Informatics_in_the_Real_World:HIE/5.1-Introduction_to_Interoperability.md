# 5.1 - Introduction to Interoperability

## The Challenge Post-Adoption: Interoperability
- **Key Point**: After EHR adoption, the next challenge is "interoperability"â€”the ability of systems to share health information.
- **Context**: The U.S Congress is concerned that the benefits of the billions invested in EHR adoption won't be fully realized without effective interoperability.

## Interconnected Challenges: Adoption and Interoperability
- **Widespread EHR Adoption**: The adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has intensified the need for interoperability.
- **Frustration Among Providers**: Medical providers using EHRs are frustrated by the inability to share data easily.

## Potential Benefits: Training Datasets
- **Automated Approaches**: Widespread EHR adoption may generate training datasets for more automated approaches to interoperability.

## Dependent Clinical Systems
- **EHRs and PHRs**: Electronic Health Records and Personal Health Records are critical systems that rely on interoperability.
- **Laboratory Information Systems**: These systems provide test results that can save lives if they reach the right place on time.
- **Pharmacy Information Systems**: These can warn against inappropriate or life-threatening medication orders but require a complete medication list.
