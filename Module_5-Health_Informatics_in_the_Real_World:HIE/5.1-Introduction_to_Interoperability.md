# 5.1 - Introduction to Interoperability

## The Challenge Post-Adoption: Interoperability
- **Key Point**: After EHR adoption, the next challenge is "interoperability"â€”the ability of systems to share health information.
- **Context**: The U.S Congress is concerned that the benefits of the billions invested in EHR adoption won't be fully realized without effective interoperability.

## Interconnected Challenges: Adoption and Interoperability
- **Widespread EHR Adoption**: The adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has intensified the need for interoperability.
- **Frustration Among Providers**: Medical providers using EHRs are frustrated by the inability to share data easily.

## Potential Benefits: Training Datasets
- **Automated Approaches**: Widespread EHR adoption may generate training datasets for more automated approaches to interoperability.

## Dependent Clinical Systems
- **EHRs and PHRs**: Electronic Health Records and Personal Health Records are critical systems that rely on interoperability.
- **Laboratory Information Systems**: These systems provide test results that can save lives if they reach the right place on time.
- **Pharmacy Information Systems**: These can warn against inappropriate or life-threatening medication orders but require a complete medication list.

## Interoperability Impediments
- **Commercial EHRs**: The variety of EHR systems and the desire for health systems to use patient data strategically.
- **Complexity**: Interoperability is complex and comes with its own set of challenges.

## Interoperability Paradigms
- **Simple Transport**: The most basic form of interoperability, where data is exchanged without the receiving system being able to interpret it.
  - _Example_: Faxing or handing over a clinical summary report to a specialist.
- **Structured Transport**: Here, data is sent in a structured format so that the receiving system knows what each piece of data represents.
  - _HL7_: Health Level Seven International (HL7) is an organization that sets international health interoperability standards.
- **Semantic Transport**: The highest level of interoperability where the receiving system can fully understand and interpret the data.
  - _Clinical Decision Support_: At this level, the receiving system can trigger clinical decision suggestions based on data from various other systems.
