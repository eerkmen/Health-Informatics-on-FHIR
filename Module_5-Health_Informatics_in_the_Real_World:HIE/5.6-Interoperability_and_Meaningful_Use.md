# 5.6 - Interoperability and Meaningful Use

## Context: Understanding Meaningful Use in Healthcare
- **Objective**: To explore how 'Meaningful Use' stages drive interoperability among various healthcare systems and stakeholders.

## Meaningful Use and Patient Engagement Framework (PEF)
- **Developers**: Developed by the HIMSS Foundation and the National eHealth Collaborative (now merged).
- **Alignment**: Meaningful use stages align with different phases of the PEF.

## Stages of Meaningful Use and Corresponding Phases in PEF
1. **Stage One: Engage Me**
   - **Specification**: Patients can view and download their electronic health records (EHR).
2. **Stage Two: Empower Me**
   - **Specification**: Far more ambitious, with a focus on various areas including:
     - Health Information Exchange (HIE) Integration
     - E-Referral Coordination Among Providers
     - Ambulatory and Hospital Records Integration
     - Inclusion of Images and Video in EHRs
     - Data from Commercial Labs, Radiology, and Pharmacies
   - **Current State**: We're far from universal implementation, but each capability exists in some form.

## Impact of Meaningful Use: A New York Study
- **Personal Health Record (PHR) Usage**: Increased from 11% in 2012 to 17% in 2013.
- **Source of PHRs**: Proportion provided by doctors or healthcare organizations rose from 50% in 2012 to 73% in 2013.
- **Demographics of PHR Users**:
  - **Mean Age**: 47.2 years
  - **Gender**: 51% female
  - **Provider EHR Usage**: 80% had a physician who used EHRs
