# 4.8 - Apple's FHIR Based Personal Health Record (PHR)

## Introduction
- **Apple's FHIR Implementation:** Post-course update about Apple allowing consumers to aggregate all their health data using FHIR.

## Features of Apple's FHIR-based PHR
- **Integrated View:** An integrated view of medical records from multiple providers.
- **User Interface:** Data is presented in a "clear easy-to-understand Timeline view".
- **Supported Clinical Resources:** Apple supports key FHIR clinical resources like allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab tests, medications, and procedures, as well as FHIR vital signs profile.
- **Argonaut Profile:** All these resources are aligned with the Argonaut profile which offers a degree of consistency.

## Isaac Kahaniâ€™s Perspective
- **Initial Skepticism:** He argues the initiative "is less than meets the eye" due to its limited data scope and unidirectional data flow. Data can only flow from healthcare institutions to the personal health record.
- **Institutional Participation:** It requires that hospitals work closely with Apple, and currently, only a small number have agreed to do so.
- **Potential Impact:** Despite these limitations, the feature could have a "major impact" due to its mass consumer platform, which could "accelerate the trend toward patient and consumer control of their own health data."
