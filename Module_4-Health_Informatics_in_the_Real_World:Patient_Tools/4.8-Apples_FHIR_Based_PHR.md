# 4.8 - Apple's FHIR Based Personal Health Record (PHR)

## Introduction
- **Apple's FHIR Implementation:** Post-course update about Apple allowing consumers to aggregate all their health data using FHIR.

## Features of Apple's FHIR-based PHR
- **Integrated View:** An integrated view of medical records from multiple providers.
- **User Interface:** Data is presented in a "clear easy-to-understand Timeline view".
- **Supported Clinical Resources:** Apple supports key FHIR clinical resources like allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab tests, medications, and procedures, as well as FHIR vital signs profile.
- **Argonaut Profile:** All these resources are aligned with the Argonaut profile which offers a degree of consistency.

## Isaac Kahani’s Perspective
- **Initial Skepticism:** He argues the initiative "is less than meets the eye" due to its limited data scope and unidirectional data flow. Data can only flow from healthcare institutions to the personal health record.
- **Institutional Participation:** It requires that hospitals work closely with Apple, and currently, only a small number have agreed to do so.
- **Potential Impact:** Despite these limitations, the feature could have a "major impact" due to its mass consumer platform, which could "accelerate the trend toward patient and consumer control of their own health data."

## Historical Context and Future Implications
- **Comparison with Google Health:** A previous example of a failed attempt at creating a similar platform that was launched in 2008 and discontinued in 2011.
- **Dr. Ida Sim’s Opinion:** Believes Apple's PHR will succeed where Google Health failed because now virtually all providers have digital record systems. Cites the 21st-century Cures Act of 2016 as a catalyst.
- **Challenges:** "Adoption and use of the data still remains a challenge" and the real value will come from third-party apps.

## Key Takeaways
- **Data Standardization:** Apple uses FHIR, which is likely to become a normative standard for personal health records.
- **User Engagement:** The challenge remains to keep users engaged through "meaningful value" which could come from third-party applications.
- **Patient Control:** The move is a step towards more patient and consumer control over their own health data.
