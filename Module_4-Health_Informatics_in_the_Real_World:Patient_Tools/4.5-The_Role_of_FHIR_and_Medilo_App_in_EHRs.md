# 4.5 - The Role of FHIR and Medilo's App in EHRs

## Introduction: The Promise of FHIR-Enabled Ecosystem
- Could a FHIR-enabled ecosystem of EHRs simplify healthcare management for patients?
- Insights from a recent HL7 FHIR applications roundtable meeting at Duke University.
> "Vendors are presenting FHIR-based solutions aimed at making it easier for patients to aggregate data from all their healthcare providers."

## Spotlight: Medilo's App
- Medilo is a new company that showcased its app at Duke University.
- Designed to streamline the process of managing medical data for patients.

### Features of Medilo's App

#### 1. Provider Identification
- The app contains a directory of 4.2 million provider profiles.
- Geolocation feature defaults to patient's current location for easier searching.

#### 2. Data Customization
- Patients can select what data and date range they wish to load into the app.

#### 3. Authentication
- Patients log in using credentials from their chosen provider's patient portal.
> "One of the key goals is to provide a meaningful medication list."

## Medication Management in Medilo's App
- One feature focuses on creating a meaningful medication list.
- Uses FHIR Medication Order resources only from providers who wrote the prescriptions.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Every new refill creates a new FHIR Medication Order resource, leading to long lists.
- Medilo's solution is to reconcile orders using RX Norm CUI numbers, six-digit codes that specifically represent medications.
> "By grouping the medication orders based on the RX Norm CUI number, the list will contain each medication only once."

## Patient's View
- Patients can view details about each prescription, including:
  - The medication itself
  - Prescribing dates
  - The prescribing physicians
> "We will look at RX Norm and its role in medication management later in the course."
