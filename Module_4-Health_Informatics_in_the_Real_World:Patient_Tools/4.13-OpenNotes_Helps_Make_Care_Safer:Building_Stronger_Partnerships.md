### Insights from Patient Safety Directors and Doctors
- **Director of Patient Safety 1**: "OpenNotes has the opportunity to break diagnostic anchoring by letting patients see and verify what the physician has noted."
- **MD 1**: "It's not just about patient engagement; it's about patient empowerment. We're inviting patients to give us feedback, which is something medicine hasn't done much."
- **MD 2**: "Moving away from 'doctor knows best' to doctor and patient working together means the team owns the outcome. This shifts behavior and builds trust."
