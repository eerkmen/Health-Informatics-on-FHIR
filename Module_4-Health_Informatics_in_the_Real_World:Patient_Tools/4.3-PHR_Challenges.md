# 4.3 - PHR Challenges

## Introduction: The Adoption Gap
- Despite advancements, PHR adoption remains limited.
- A recent study indicates 20% to 30% adoption among patients, although forecasts claim a majority will use PHR by 2020.

## Major Challenges in PHR Adoption

### 1. Data Accessibility
- How does PHR data get incorporated into a patient's record, especially when they receive care from multiple providers?
- Interoperability is a significant hurdle.

### 2. Privacy Concerns
- Risks related to data breaches, misuse by employers, and misuse by insurers.

### 3. Patient Engagement
- Meaningful use has terms like "View, Download, Transmit" (VDT) to measure patient engagement.
- More than 50% of unique patients must have timely access, and more than 5% must actively use this capability.

### 4. Usability
- Lack of computer literacy, unfamiliarity with medical terms, and other user-centric challenges.

## Case Example: Modern Patient Portal by MCIS
- Marshfield Clinic Information Services (MCIS) offers an example of a comprehensive patient portal.
- The portal amalgamates health records, test reminders, messaging, and even financial services.

## Regulatory Framework: Meaningful Use and Data Sharing
- Meaningful use mandates that providers give electronic access to patient records.
- "Continuity of Care Document" (CCD) is an HL7-specified XML-formatted electronic patient summary.

> "The second measure in Meaningful Use seems designed to incentivize providers to explain their VDT tool and encourage their patients to use it."

## Public Concern: Privacy and Security
- A 2008 Markle Foundation survey showed that 77% had concerns about data misuse by marketeers, 56% by employers, and 53% by health insurers.

## What Do Patients Want?
- Access to past medical history, lab tests, medications, appointments, and communication with providers.

> "Several studies have focused on what functionalities patients would most like to see in a PHR system."

## Barriers to Usability
- Age, lack of computer literacy, and unfamiliarity with medical terminology.

## Takeaway
The challenges in PHR adoption are multifaceted, involving not just technical but also social, ethical, and regulatory considerations.
