# 4.2 - Personal Health Records (PHR)

## Overview: What is PHR?
- Personal Health Records (PHR) is a concept that allows patients to aggregate, access, and manage their own health data.
- The term was first coined in a 1978 paper, but it became practical around 2000 due to the decline in computing costs and the rise of the Internet.
> Markle Foundation's Definition: "An electronic application through which individuals can access, manage, and share their health information, and that of others for whom they are authorized, in a private, secure, and confidential environment."

## Key Questions and Potential Benefits
- Should patients aggregate all their health data?
- Should they contribute data via devices and apps?
- Should they have access to physician's notes and suggest corrections?
- Will personal technologies engage them and lead to better outcomes?
> "These are the fundamental questions driving the evolution and potential benefits of PHR."

## Evolution: PHR in the Modern World
- The original concept was for a patient-maintained record, but its scope is expanding.
- Smartphones provide a near-ideal, ubiquitous PHR platform.
