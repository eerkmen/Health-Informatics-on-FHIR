# 4.7 - Deep Dive into Care Evolution's FHIR-Based PHR (myFHIR)

## Introduction: User Onboarding on myFHIR App
- Starting with a user named Mary who has already established an account and logged in.
- Mary has added patient notes and uploaded a diagnostic X-ray report.

## Interacting with the Settings Tab: Adding a Provider Data Source

1. Navigate to the Settings tab and click on "Add a provider data source."
2. Search for providers by state, zip code, or name.
3. Epic is selected as the provider for this demo.

> Note: After granting access, the app requires linking the Mary A account from Epic to the Mary A account on myFHIR. This is required only if all identifying fields between the two platforms do not match.

## Syncing Data: How it Works
- A connection to Epic Sandbox as a data provider is established.
- The app automatically downloads Mary's health data from Epic and integrates it into myFHIR.
- A time-stamped data refresh is visible.

## Profile Overview: Checking Medications
- Navigate back to Mary's profile to see the updated medication list.
- All the listed medications come from the Epic connection.

## Adding Multiple Data Sources: CareEvolution's Provider
- Another data source, CareEvolutionâ€™s provider, is added.
- The system allows Mary to select the patient from all accessible profiles, including family members.

## Merged Data
- The medication list now incorporates data from both sources.
> Note: It's highlighted that not all providers are aware of all medications.

## Understanding Discrepancies: Summary Screen Insights
- The summary screen specifies which medications are known to all providers and which are known to only some.
- "Focus is placed on active medications".

## Real-world Scenario: Preparing for an Appointment
- In preparation for an appointment with Epic, Mary can notify the provider about medications they are not aware of.

## Adding More Providers: Cedar-Sinai as a Third Data Source
- Cedar-Sinai is added as a third data source.
- New data, including immunizations and allergies, is pulled in.
