  - **Role Description:** "Paid by the federal government to cause trouble inside the federal government."

## Origins of Blue Button on FHIR
- **Blue Button:** Has been available for nearly seven years as a text file that patients can download.
- **Problem:** Every Blue Button file is different; this presents challenges for developers.
- **Solution:** Transition to Blue Button on FHIR, essentially converting it into a data API.
  - _"The advantage of using an industry API is as the API matures and the tools around it mature, everybody wins."_

## Size and Scope of Data Available
- **Target Population:** All Medicare beneficiaries (around 38 million individuals).
- **Data Types:** Part A (hospital), Part B (professional), and Part D (pharmacy).
- **Volume:** Three years' worth of data, equating to roughly six to eight billion records.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Claims Data
- **Advantages:**
  - Recognizable to patients.
  - Comprehensive coverage of services.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Lacks clinical data.
  - Requires extensions for other data sets.
  - _"The Blue Button API could be used for example in a hospital situation or maybe for the Veterans Administration..."_

## Authorization and Data Security
- **Authorization:** Each patient must authorize access to their data.
- **Trust Communities or Endorsers:** Could validate third-party applications.
- **HIPAA:** Patients have an absolute right to their data.
  - _"It's a complex scenario and I think we have to have a range of solutions that tie together to reduce the risk for the data holder..."_

## Benefits and Goals of Blue Button on FHIR
- **Consumer-Centric Healthcare:** Aims to empower patients to take control of their health.
- **Data Utilization:** Patients desire to use their data for various purposes, from research to personal health management.
  - _"It's going to be their choice. And we want to simply make the data flow..."_

## Future Plans
- **Open-Source the API:** Aiming for broader adoption.
- **Address Trust Issues:** For data holders, developers, and patients.
  - _"We'd love to see it get adopted not only in this country but internationally, which is certainly within the realms of possibility because FHIR is an international standard."_
