# 4.4 - Exploring PHRs: Webchart Exercise

## Introduction: PHR Platforms
- While Microsoft's HealthVault PHR used to be an example, it has been discontinued as of November 2019.
- Currently, the course uses Webchart PHR as an alternative for demonstrating PHR concepts.

## Key Features of a Modern PHR

### 1. Health Information Tracking
- Keeps records of common health information that patients desire.

### 2. Data Integration
- Capable of uploading data from various personal devices and apps.

### 3. Provider Information
- Allows for the uploading of health information directly from a patient's healthcare providers.

> "Note that a good PHR should display the patient's health record in a user-friendly manner, often using tiles or dashboards."

## Data Standards and Protocols
- Support for Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs) which are pre-FHIR HL7 standards for XML-formatted patient summaries.
- Meaningful Use Stage 2 objectives require the latest HL7 document standard, known as CCDA.
- CCDs are templates within the CCDA standard that are particularly suited for PHRs.

> "Any PHR software that supports these standards should be able to upload and correctly store data from CCDs created by the patient's providers EHR."

## User Experience: Adding and Viewing Records
- Modern PHRs generally offer a simple interface for adding items.
- Many browsers will render XML documents in a human-readable form, making CCDs quite readable for the user.

## Sharing Options and Privacy
- PHRs usually allow the sharing of health records with invitees, such as family members.
- Because of privacy concerns, patients can often choose what specific types of information they wish to share.

> "Understanding medical terminology and computer literacy can be barriers to effective use of PHRs."

## Challenges and Opportunities
- Do you think computer literacy might be a barrier for some patients?
- Is there a more usable way for patients to express their sharing preferences and choices?

> "If you have a device or use an app that can record health data, try to upload data to Webchart to better understand the user experience."

## Supported Apps and Devices
- Modern PHRs support an extensive list of apps and devices for seamless data integration.
