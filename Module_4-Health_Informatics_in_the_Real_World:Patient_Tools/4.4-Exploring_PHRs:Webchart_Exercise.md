# 4.4 - Exploring PHRs: Webchart Exercise

## Introduction: PHR Platforms
- While Microsoft's HealthVault PHR used to be an example, it has been discontinued as of November 2019.
- Currently, the course uses Webchart PHR as an alternative for demonstrating PHR concepts.

## Key Features of a Modern PHR

### 1. Health Information Tracking
- Keeps records of common health information that patients desire.

### 2. Data Integration
- Capable of uploading data from various personal devices and apps.

### 3. Provider Information
- Allows for the uploading of health information directly from a patient's healthcare providers.

> "Note that a good PHR should display the patient's health record in a user-friendly manner, often using tiles or dashboards."
