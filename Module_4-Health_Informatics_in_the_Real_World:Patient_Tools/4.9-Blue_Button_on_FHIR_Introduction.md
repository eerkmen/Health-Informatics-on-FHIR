# 4.9 - Blue Button on FHIR Introduction

## Introduction
- The session explores the possibilities of automating patient data access across multiple healthcare systems, focusing on Medicare's Blue Button on FHIR initiative.

## Patient Portals and Personal Health Records (PHR)
- **Patient Portals:** Initially viewed as a means to automate patient data retrieval, though they may be limited to a single health system.
- **PHRs and FHIR Apps:** Tools such as these can facilitate data management across multiple healthcare providers.

## Insurance Companies and Comprehensive Care Data
- **Role of Insurance Providers:** Given that patients finance most of their care, insurance companies should technically possess a comprehensive view of a patient's medical history.
- **Limitations:** While claims data may indicate when a lab test was conducted, it won’t reveal the results. Nonetheless, it often provides the "most comprehensive longitudinal view of a patient's care that is practically available."

## Medicare's Blue Button on FHIR Initiative
- An innovative approach is being employed by Medicare’s Blue Button on FHIR, aiming to enhance patient empowerment.

## Key Takeaways
- **Potential for Automation:** There exists significant potential to simplify the process of data retrieval for patients across various healthcare systems.
- **Importance of Insurance Data:** Claims data from insurance providers can furnish a comprehensive, albeit limited, perspective on patient care.
- **Patient Empowerment:** Steps are being taken by Medicare to fortify patient empowerment by making comprehensive care data accessible through the Blue Button on FHIR initiative.
