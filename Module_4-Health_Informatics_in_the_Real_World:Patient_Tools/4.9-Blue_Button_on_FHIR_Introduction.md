# 4.9 - Blue Button on FHIR Introduction

## Introduction
- The session explores the possibilities of automating patient data access across multiple healthcare systems, focusing on Medicare's Blue Button on FHIR initiative.

## Patient Portals and Personal Health Records (PHR)
- **Patient Portals:** Initially viewed as a means to automate patient data retrieval, though they may be limited to a single health system.
- **PHRs and FHIR Apps:** Tools such as these can facilitate data management across multiple healthcare providers.

## Insurance Companies and Comprehensive Care Data
- **Role of Insurance Providers:** Given that patients finance most of their care, insurance companies should technically possess a comprehensive view of a patient's medical history.
- **Limitations:** While claims data may indicate when a lab test was conducted, it wonâ€™t reveal the results. Nonetheless, it often provides the "most comprehensive longitudinal view of a patient's care that is practically available."
