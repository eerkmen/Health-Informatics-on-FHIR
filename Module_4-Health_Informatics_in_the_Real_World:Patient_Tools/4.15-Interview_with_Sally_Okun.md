# 4.15 - Interview with Sally Okun, VP of Advocacy, Policy, and Public Safety at Patients Like Me

## Interview Participants:
- **Mark**: Interviewer
- **Sally Okun**: Vice President of Advocacy, Policy, and Public Safety at Patients Like Me

## Origins of Patients Like Me
- **Inspiration**: The story of Stephen Haywood, diagnosed with ALS.
  - Stephen's brothers, Jamie and Ben Haywood, along with friend Jeff Cole, began a journey to find potential treatments.
- **Main Discovery**: The team realized that crucial information often came directly from other patients and their families.
- **Inception**: This led to the creation of Patients Like Me, a platform dedicated to learning, connecting, and sharing patient data.

## Research Contributions: The Lithium Case
- **Pioneering Study**: A study in Italy suggested that lithium could slow the progression of ALS.
  - **Response**: 348 Patients Like Me users, diagnosed with ALS, started using Lithium under their doctors' supervision.
- **Results**: The collected data did not corroborate the initial claims of the Italian study.
  - **Significance**: This highlighted the importance and impact of patient research networks.
- **Control Group**: A novel algorithm was used to create a matching control group from the active patient community.

## Expansion of Patients Like Me
- **User Base**: The platform supports 270,000 patients, spanning over 2,000 different conditions.
  - **Beginnings**: Initially centered around neurological conditions like ALS and MS.
  - **Broadening**: Expanded to encompass large communities for conditions including Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, and various mood conditions.

## Informatics Infrastructure
- **Team Composition**: Comprising 80 staff members, including engineers, software developers, UX specialists, research scientists, data scientists, and clinicians.
- **Data Standardization**:
  - All patient data is coded against standardized terminologies such as "ICD", "SNOMED", "mEDRA", and "RxNorm", ensuring interoperability.

## Involvement in Clinical Trials
- **Data Integration**: Nightly downloads of data from clinicaltrials.gov aid patients in finding suitable clinical trials.
  - **Trial Access**: A new service designed to assist the pharmaceutical industry in creating patient-centered clinical trials.
- **Patient Contribution**: Patients are empowered to provide practical insights into the development of clinical trials.

## Future Outlook
- **Record Uploading**: Development is underway on a feature that will allow patients to upload their electronic health records, enabling seamless data sharing.

## Key Concepts to Remember
- Patient-driven research is a foundational element of Patients Like Me's mission.
- Ensuring data standardization is crucial for achieving interoperability across different healthcare systems.
- The platform is a staunch advocate for the development of patient-centered clinical trials.
- The sense of community and shared experience plays a vital role in improving healthcare outcomes.
