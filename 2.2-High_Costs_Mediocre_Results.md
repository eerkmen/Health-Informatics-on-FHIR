## 2.2 - High Costs, Mediocre Results

### Introduction: The "World's Best Healthcare System"?
- Dr. Brent James, an expert on healthcare quality at Intermountain Healthcare, provides data.
- U.S. often touted as having the world's best healthcare.

### The Positive Aspect: High-Tech Medicine
- U.S. has lowest mortality rates for high-technology medicine.
    - Examples include care post-heart attack or major trauma.
> **Note:** "That's the positive part of the story."

### A Closer Look: The Commonwealth Fund
- Private foundation aimed at promoting high-performing healthcare.
- Focuses on vulnerable citizens.

### Unpleasant Reality: Spending vs. Outcomes
- U.S. spends twice as much per capita on healthcare compared to six other industrialized nations.
- Overall rank at the bottom for:
    - Quality
    - Access
    - Efficiency
    - Equity of care

> **Quote:** "Our citizens also rank at the bottom with respect to living long, healthy, productive lives."

This lesson raises critical questions about the U.S. healthcare system, especially when considering the high costs and mediocre outcomes on multiple parameters. It dispels the notion that spending more necessarily leads to better healthcare and draws attention to the areas in need of significant improvement.
