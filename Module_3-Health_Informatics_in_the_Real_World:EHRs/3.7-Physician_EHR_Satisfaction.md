- The study involved:
  - 30 physician practices.
  - Structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews.
  - Response rate of 68% among surveyed physicians.

**Note**: This study is considered one of the most definitive on the topic of physician EHR satisfaction.

- Majority believe EHR improves care quality, but consider it inefficient.
- Only 18% would revert to paper records if they could.
- According to the American Academy of Family Practice (AAFP), physician satisfaction is declining.

## Emerging Trends: American EHR Partners

- American EHR Partners, a new effort supported by multiple professional societies, has been tracking satisfaction over time.
- Key Findings from the 2014 American EHR survey:
  - 42% found improving efficiency difficult.
  - 72% found decreasing workload difficult.
  - 54% said EHRs increased total operating costs.
  - 43% have not overcome productivity challenges.

**Caution**: The response rate for the survey was low (2.6%), suggesting possible response bias. However, American EHR claims the results have been consistent over time.
