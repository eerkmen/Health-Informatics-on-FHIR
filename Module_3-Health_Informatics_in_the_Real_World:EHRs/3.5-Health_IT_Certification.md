# 3.5 - Health IT Certification

## Introduction: Role of ONC
- The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) administers the Health IT Certification (HIT) program.
- Voluntary in nature, but crucial for EHR vendors.

## Core Components of the HIT Certification
1. Capabilities
   - Recording
   - Security
   - Interoperable sharing of health information
2. Technical Requirements
   - Defines the technical specifications for health IT.
3. Certification Process
   - Commercial authorized testing labs perform the assessments using ONC-provided criteria and datasets.

## Business Necessity for EHR Vendors
- Certified EHR is a prerequisite for hospitals and providers to receive incentive payments, making certification virtually a business necessity.
- ONC's progress is publicly available on their HIT Dashboard site.

## Key Statistics (as of July 2016)
- 632 vendors supplied certified health IT to 337,432 primary care providers.
- 175 certified vendors supplied to 4,474 non-federal acute care hospitals.

## The Interoperability Challenge
- Despite multiple vendors, interoperability remains a challenge.
- The market for non-federal acute care hospitals is more concentrated; just ten vendors supplied about 98% of hospitals.
- Challenges are not limited to technology; some hospitals aim to control access to digital records for business reasons.

## Toward Interoperability: FIRE and SMART on FIRE
- Top vendors have announced support for FHIR and SMART on FHIR as an EHR connected platform for apps, including those written by third parties.
- This "liberation" of EHR data may not be classic interoperability but could lead to solving some EHR challenges.

**Note**: Understanding HIT certification and the barriers to interoperability is crucial for grasping the real-world challenges and opportunities in health informatics.

## Questions to Consider
- What are the implications of lack of interoperability?
- How can modern technologies like FHIR help in overcoming these challenges?

**Takeaway**: Certification is not just a technical hurdle; itâ€™s a business necessity, and achieving true interoperability remains a multifaceted challenge.
