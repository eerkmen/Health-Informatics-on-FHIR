- Voluntary in nature, but crucial for EHR vendors.

## Core Components of the HIT Certification
1. Capabilities
   - Recording
   - Security
   - Interoperable sharing of health information
2. Technical Requirements
   - Defines the technical specifications for health IT.
3. Certification Process
   - Commercial authorized testing labs perform the assessments using ONC-provided criteria and datasets.

## Business Necessity for EHR Vendors
- Certified EHR is a prerequisite for hospitals and providers to receive incentive payments, making certification virtually a business necessity.
- ONC's progress is publicly available on their HIT Dashboard site.

## Key Statistics (as of July 2016)
- 632 vendors supplied certified health IT to 337,432 primary care providers.
