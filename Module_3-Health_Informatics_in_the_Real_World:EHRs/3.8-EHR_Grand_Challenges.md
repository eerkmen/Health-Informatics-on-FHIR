# 3.8 - EHR Grand Challenges

## Introduction: The Context

- A 2009 report from the National Academies of Science discussed the limitations and challenges of EHR systems.
- Co-edited by Dr. William Stead, head of Vanderbilt University's biomedical informatics department.

## The Report's Core Argument

- IT applications in healthcare often aim to automate tasks or business processes.
- They often mimic existing paper-based forms and do not support the cognitive tasks of clinicians.
- This results in poor designs that can increase chances of error and add workload.

> "These applications sometimes increase workload, and they can introduce new forms of error that are difficult to detect."

## Connection to Physician EHR Surveys

- The report’s conclusions align with physician frustrations, indicating a one-size-fits-all approach to EHR systems.

## Seven Information-Intensive Aspects EHRs Often Fail to Provide

1. Comprehensive data on conditions, treatments, and outcomes.
2. Support for integrating patient-specific data.
3. Evidence-based practice guidelines.
4. Tools for patient portfolio management.
5. Rapid integration of new technologies and knowledge.
6. Diverse care locales, including home instrumentation.
7. Empowerment of patients and their families.

*These are called "clinical deficiencies" and are increasingly relevant due to new care and payment models.*

## Current EHR Limitations

- Most EHRs are focused on billing and administrative processes.

## Promising Approaches to Address Challenges

1. **FHIR apps**: Specific to conditions, they can display previously recorded data, saving physician time. Example from Geisinger Health System.
2. **Machine Learning and Neural Networks**: These can train EHRs to adapt to the physician’s clinical approach, thus saving time. Example from Praxis EHR.

*Praxis consistently receives high user satisfaction ratings, indicating that this approach works.*
