# 3.8 - EHR Grand Challenges

## Introduction: The Context

- A 2009 report from the National Academies of Science discussed the limitations and challenges of EHR systems.
- Co-edited by Dr. William Stead, head of Vanderbilt University's biomedical informatics department.

## The Report's Core Argument

- IT applications in healthcare often aim to automate tasks or business processes.
- They often mimic existing paper-based forms and do not support the cognitive tasks of clinicians.
- This results in poor designs that can increase chances of error and add workload.

> "These applications sometimes increase workload, and they can introduce new forms of error that are difficult to detect."
