# 3.2 - The Adoption Challenges

## Overview: The Remarkable Rise of EMR Adoption
- Rapid growth in the adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR).
  - As of 2008: 4% of providers had a basic EMR system.
  - As of 2009: Only 1.5% of non-federal hospitals had an EMR system.
  - Current Status: Most hospitals and around half of all providers now use an EMR system.

**Note**: These statistics are based on papers published in "The New England Journal of Medicine," a leading journal in the field. It is recommended to read these papers for deeper insight.

## The Veterans Administration (V.A.) â€“ A Pioneer
- Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)
  - Dates back to the 1980s.
  - Consists of nearly 180 applications for clinical, financial, administrative, and infrastructure needs.
  - Images can be retrieved by any physician in the system, a capability not widely available in U.S. healthcare.

## Factors that Accelerated EMR Adoption
1. Federal Intervention
   - Long argued as the only viable path to widespread EMR adoption.
   - Addresses the economic challenge of initial investment and transition difficulties.
2. Pay-for-Procedure Reimbursement Model
   - EMR could reduce revenue by eliminating unnecessary or duplicative care.
3. Network Benefits
   - The more providers adopt EMR, the more valuable it becomes due to data sharing.
