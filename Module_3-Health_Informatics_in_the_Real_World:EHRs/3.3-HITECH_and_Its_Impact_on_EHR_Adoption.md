# 3.3 - HITECH and Its Impact on EHR Adoption

## Introduction: The Economic Barrier to EHR Adoption
- The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) was designed to overcome the economic challenges of EHR adoption.
- It is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the Stimulus.

## The Three Core Elements of HITECH
1. HIT Certification
   - Defines minimum functional requirements for EHRs and other clinical tools.
2. Meaningful Use
   - Specifies the minimum usage requirements that hospitals and providers must meet for their EHR systems.
3. Incentive Payments
   - Financial incentives provided to hospitals and providers for adopting a certified EHR and meeting 'Meaningful Use' requirements.

**Note**: These elements are interdependent and apply primarily to hospitals and providers participating in Medicare or Medicaid.

## Eligibility and Timeline
- Eligible for incentive payments between 2011 and 2015.
- Payments came through either Medicare or Medicaid.
- Providers could only be eligible for one program, but hospitals could be eligible for both.
- Annual limits were set on the incentive payments.
- The total amount a provider could earn depended on the stages of 'Meaningful Use' achieved.

**Important Statistic**: As of October 2015, more than 479,000 healthcare providers received incentive payments.

## Questions to Consider
- How have these economic incentives shaped the landscape of EHR adoption?
- What challenges and limitations do providers face in meeting the criteria for 'Meaningful Use'?

**Takeaway**: HITECH has significantly impacted the acceleration of EHR adoption by providing financial incentives and setting standards, thus addressing the economic barriers in the healthcare industry.
