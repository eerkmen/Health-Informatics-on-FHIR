# 3.3 - HITECH and Its Impact on EHR Adoption

## Introduction: The Economic Barrier to EHR Adoption
- The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) was designed to overcome the economic challenges of EHR adoption.
- It is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the Stimulus.

## The Three Core Elements of HITECH
1. HIT Certification
   - Defines minimum functional requirements for EHRs and other clinical tools.
2. Meaningful Use
   - Specifies the minimum usage requirements that hospitals and providers must meet for their EHR systems.
3. Incentive Payments
   - Financial incentives provided to hospitals and providers for adopting a certified EHR and meeting 'Meaningful Use' requirements.

**Note**: These elements are interdependent and apply primarily to hospitals and providers participating in Medicare or Medicaid.
