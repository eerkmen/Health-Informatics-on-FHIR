## Definitions and Historical Focus
1. EMR (Electronic Medical Records)
   - These are digital records of a patient as recorded by one or more healthcare providers.
   - Historical Focus: Earlier electronic records were primarily EMRs, focused only on medical records created by healthcare providers.
2. EHR (Electronic Health Records)
