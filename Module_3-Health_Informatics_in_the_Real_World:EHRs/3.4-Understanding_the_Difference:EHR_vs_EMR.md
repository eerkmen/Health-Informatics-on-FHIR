# 3.4 - Understanding the Difference: EHR vs. EMR

## Introduction: The Confusion Between EHR and EMR
- It's crucial to distinguish between Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) as they serve different functions in healthcare.

## Definitions and Historical Focus
1. EMR (Electronic Medical Records)
   - These are digital records of a patient as recorded by one or more healthcare providers.
   - Historical Focus: Earlier electronic records were primarily EMRs, focused only on medical records created by healthcare providers.
2. EHR (Electronic Health Records)
   - A complete record of a patient's health, going beyond the medical records provided by healthcare providers.

## The Modern Requirement for Interoperability
- With the rise of the Internet, mobile apps, wearable measurement technologies, and social networking, a comprehensive patient view requires interoperability.
- EHRs are meant to combine data from all of a patient's providers along with additional data from these other sources.

**Note**: The key difference lies in the scope and interoperability. EHRs aim for a complete, interconnected view of a patient's health, while EMRs are more provider-centric.
