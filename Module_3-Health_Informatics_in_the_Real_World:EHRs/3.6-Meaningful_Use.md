# 3.6 - Meaningful Use

## Introduction: Complexity and Goals

- Meaningful Use is a complex, three-stage program coordinating with Medicare reimbursement.
- The central goals are:
  - Use of certified EHR technology in a clinically meaningful manner (e.g., e-prescribing).
  - Electronic exchange of health information to improve healthcare quality.
  - Submit clinical quality and other measures.

## Sub-goals for Clinical Care

1. Improving care coordination
2. Reducing healthcare disparities
3. Engaging patients and their families
4. Improving population and public health
5. Ensuring adequate privacy and security

**Note**: These goals align well with what experts believe is needed to manage chronic diseases better.

## Historical Context: Timeline

- The Meaningful Use program began in 2010.
- Starting in 2015, Medicare payments were reduced for hospitals and providers not meeting Meaningful Use standards.
