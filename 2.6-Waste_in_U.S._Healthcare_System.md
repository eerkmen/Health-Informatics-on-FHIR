## 2.6 - Waste in U.S. Healthcare System

### Introduction: The Issue of Waste
- **Waste** accounts for around 30% of all U.S. healthcare spending according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM).
- A contentious issue that has been persistent for decades.
> **Note:** "The ratio of wasteful spending has remained unchanged for decades."

### Categories of Wasteful Spending
- **Health Affairs**, a respected journal, breaks down wasteful spending into multiple categories:
  1. **Failures of Care Delivery**
     - Poor execution or failure to adopt best practices
     - Includes ineffective preventive care or patient safety
  2. **Failures of Care Coordination**
     - Fragmented and disjointed care during transitions between care settings
     - A major use case for health informatics
  3. **Over-treatment**
     - Ignorance of scientific evidence
     - Includes defensive medicine and use of high-priced services with negligible benefits
     - Another major use case for informatics, especially clinical decision support
  4. **Administrative Complexity**
     - Excess spending due to inefficient or flawed rules and bureaucratic procedures
     - Multiplicity of insurance plans and government programs exacerbates the issue
  5. **Pricing Failure**
     - Pricing exceeds the costs of production plus reasonable profit
     - Notably, pharmaceutical costs in the U.S. are significantly higher
