## 2.6 - Waste in U.S. Healthcare System

### Introduction: The Issue of Waste
- **Waste** accounts for around 30% of all U.S. healthcare spending according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM).
- A contentious issue that has been persistent for decades.
> **Note:** "The ratio of wasteful spending has remained unchanged for decades."

### Categories of Wasteful Spending
- **Health Affairs**, a respected journal, breaks down wasteful spending into multiple categories:
  1. **Failures of Care Delivery**
     - Poor execution or failure to adopt best practices
     - Includes ineffective preventive care or patient safety
  2. **Failures of Care Coordination**
     - Fragmented and disjointed care during transitions between care settings
     - A major use case for health informatics
  3. **Over-treatment**
     - Ignorance of scientific evidence
     - Includes defensive medicine and use of high-priced services with negligible benefits
     - Another major use case for informatics, especially clinical decision support
  4. **Administrative Complexity**
     - Excess spending due to inefficient or flawed rules and bureaucratic procedures
     - Multiplicity of insurance plans and government programs exacerbates the issue
  5. **Pricing Failure**
     - Pricing exceeds the costs of production plus reasonable profit
     - Notably, pharmaceutical costs in the U.S. are significantly higher
  6. **Fraud and Abuse**
     - Includes the cost of the fraud itself and additional inspections and regulations to catch wrongdoing

This section outlines the pervasive issue of waste in the U.S. healthcare system. It categorizes waste into six types: failures of care delivery, failures of care coordination, over-treatment, administrative complexity, pricing failure, and fraud and abuse. Each of these categories has its own complexities and challenges, with many serving as potential areas where health informatics could bring improvements.
