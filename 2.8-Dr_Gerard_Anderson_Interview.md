## 2.8 Dr. Gerard Anderson Interview - The Growing Burden of Chronic Disease in America

### Introduction
An interview with Dr. Gerard Anderson, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Anderson is the first author of the seminal paper "The Rising Tide of Chronic Disease in America," which course instructor Mike Braunstein cites frequently.

### Chronic Diseases: Where Are We Now?
**Mike Braunstein**: Questions the progress made since the publication of the paper a decade ago.

**Dr. Gerard Anderson**:
- Notes that 150 million Americans, nearly one out of every two, have one or more chronic conditions.
- Current efforts are more geared towards changing the delivery system, starting with prevention but also focusing on care and cure.
  
> "I was more optimistic 10 years ago than I am now. Most everything that we've tried recently has just not worked very well."

### Health IT and Information Exchanges
**Mike Braunstein**: Discusses attempts to make the healthcare industry adopt health IT.

**Dr. Gerard Anderson**:
- Is optimistic about the adoption of Health IT.
- Discusses the 'dashboard problem' where doctors have very limited time to absorb complex medical histories.

> "For the patient who only has diabetes, it's easy. But for that patient, who has multiple conditions... that's the challenge."

### Incentives and Global Models
**Mike Braunstein**: Inquires about incentives in the healthcare system.

**Dr. Gerard Anderson**:
- Talks about care coordination programs around the world that have largely failed.
- Admits that it's hard to find models that save money, improve outcomes, and improve satisfaction.

> "We know what we need to do... but we haven't been able to figure it out."

### The Financial Burden and GDP
**Mike Braunstein**: Discusses healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP, questioning its sustainability.

**Dr. Gerard Anderson**:
- Mentions that two-thirds of Medicare spending is by people with five or more chronic conditions.
- Notes that all the growth in the economy will go to support the growth in healthcare if we reach close to 30% of GDP spent on healthcare.

> "We've got to get the system right for these people; we just don't know how to do it yet."
