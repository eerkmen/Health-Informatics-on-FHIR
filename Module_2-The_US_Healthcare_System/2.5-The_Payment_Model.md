## 2.5 - The Payment Model

### Introduction: Evolution of Healthcare Payments
- **Pre-World War II:** U.S. patients paid for most healthcare, which was relatively inexpensive.
- **Post-World War II:** Boom in the U.S. economy, health insurance became an attractive but inexpensive employee benefit.

### Government's Role in Health Insurance
- **Early 1960s:** The Federal Government introduced:
  - Medicare for citizens over 65
  - Medicaid primarily for the poor and those with certain disabilities.
> **Note:** "The government became a major player in healthcare payments through the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid."

### Complex Mixture of Payment Sources
- Graphic from the California Health Care Foundation outlines the variety of payment sources.
- Contributions vary depending on the kind of care.

### Traditional Payment Model
- **Pay for Procedures:** Until quite recently, payments were mostly based on the volume of care delivered.
> **Quote:** "Individual providers and hospitals are paid on the basis of how much care they deliver."

This section traces the historical development of healthcare payment models in the United States. Starting from a time when healthcare was mostly out-of-pocket, the lecture discusses the government's role in healthcare funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The current payment system is complex, with multiple stakeholders and different kinds of financial contributions. Importantly, the traditional model focused on "pay for procedures," where payments were determined by the amount of care provided rather than the quality or effectiveness of that care.
