## 2.15 - Case Study: Dr. John Sweeney Onsite at Emory University

### Introduction
- Dr. John Sweeney, Joseph Brown Whitehead professor of surgery and chairman of the Department of Surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, discusses the readmission problem in healthcare.

### Background and Context
- Interest in this problem sparked around 2009-2010, based on a landmark paper in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2007.
- Almost 20% of Medicare patients were readmitted within 30 days after discharge, costing billions.
- Patient Protection Affordable Care Act Section 13:24, the Readmission Reduction Act, penalizes hospitals for excessive readmission rates.

### The Complexity of the Problem
- Several factors must be considered, not just readmission rates.
    1. Decision to send the patient home: Was the patient ready for discharge?
    2. Cost considerations: Longer stays equate to higher costs.
- Doctors are incentivized to reduce costs but must avoid quick discharges that could lead to readmissions.

### Solution Approach
- Predictive model was built with the help of economists at Georgia State.
- Focuses on complex GI surgery patients at Emory, who have high readmission rates.
- The tool aims to provide timely and effective decisions to reduce readmission rates and decrease healthcare costs.

### Testing and Validation
- The tool was tested in simulated settings, including computer simulations and mock patient actors.
- Showed that the tool could reduce readmissions and improve patient outcomes.
