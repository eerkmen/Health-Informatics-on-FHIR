- **2013 Data:** Uninsured people receive substantially less healthcare than the insured.
- **2015 Data:** The uninsured are more likely to:
  - Have no regular source of care.
  - Postpone or do without needed care.
  - Not get needed prescriptions due to cost.
> **Note:** "Healthcare access is significantly worse for uninsured individuals."

### Similar Plans for Follow-Up Care
- Both insured and uninsured who are injured or newly diagnosed with chronic conditions receive similar plans for follow-up care.

### Discrepancies in Healthcare Service Utilization
- People without health coverage are less likely to obtain all the recommended services than those with coverage.

### Consequences of Lack of Regular Outpatient Care
- Uninsured are more likely to end up with expensive hospitalizations for avoidable health problems.
- More likely to experience declines in their overall health.

### Hospitalization Outcomes
- When hospitalized, uninsured people receive fewer diagnostic and therapeutic services.
- Higher mortality rates than those with insurance.

> **Quote:** "Because the uninsured are less likely to have regular outpatient care, they are more likely to end up with expensive hospitalizations for avoidable health problems and to experience declines in their overall health."

This section highlights the impact of insurance status on the quality and quantity of healthcare received. It emphasizes the disparities between the insured and uninsured, using data from the reputable Kaiser Family Foundation to illustrate these points. The consequences of lack of insurance extend to more expensive hospitalizations and poorer health outcomes, reinforcing the idea that being uninsured not only raises individual costs but also societal healthcare expenditures.
