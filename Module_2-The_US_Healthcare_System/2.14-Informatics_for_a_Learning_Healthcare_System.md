## 2.14 - Informatics for a Learning Healthcare System

### Introduction
Discussion on key informatics challenges that need to be addressed to build a Learning Healthcare System.

### Three Key Informatics Challenges
1. **Digital Records Adoption**: Providers must transition to digital records.
2. **Interoperability**: Systems must be able to share data across different platforms.
3. **Data Analysis and Presentation**: Aggregated, shared data must be analyzed and presented in a clinically useful and timely manner.

### Status of Adoption
- The federal government's high-tech program has largely solved the challenge of digital record adoption.

### Role of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
- FHIR apps offer solutions for interoperability and timely data presentation.
- Enables the "timely and useful presentation of the results of the new knowledge gleaned from analysis of past care to busy physicians."

### Economics and Incentives
- Economic factors play a key role in the adoption of a Learning Healthcare System.
- Providers are more likely to engage if they see clear benefits and incentives for efficiency.

### Summary
- In order to develop a Learning Healthcare System, the informatics landscape needs to address challenges in digital record adoption, interoperability, and data presentation. This is further influenced by economic incentives for healthcare providers.

> These lecture notes outline the informatics challenges and solutions that are central to developing a Learning Healthcare System that is not just efficient but also continuously improving.
