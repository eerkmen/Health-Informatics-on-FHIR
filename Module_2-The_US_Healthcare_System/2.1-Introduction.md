# 2.1 - Introduction

## Why Discuss the U.S. Healthcare System?
- Complexity of the U.S. healthcare system warrants attention.
- Suggested readings provided for more depth.
- Importance of understanding the structure and economics of healthcare, especially for those in a health informatics course.

## Context: Why Georgia Tech Students Need This Knowledge
- Many students come with little background in healthcare delivery.
- Health Informatics is fundamentally about applying IT to healthcare.
- A basic grounding is needed to appreciate the system and how informatics can contribute.

## The Potential of Health Informatics
- Can help avoid medical errors due to information overload or inadequacy.
- Helps in identifying and reducing waste and duplicative services.
- Critical for surveillance in cases like foodborne illnesses and disease outbreaks.
- Use of data mining and analytics for new medicines, treatment protocols, and earlier diagnosis.
  Note: "Each of these benefits depends, to one degree or another, on the ability to share digital data."

## Current Focus: Data Sharing and Interoperability
- Most hospitals and around half of all providers now have electronic record systems.
- Data sharing and interoperability are now the focus.
- This course will dive into HL7 FHIR standard and its role in creating interoperability.

## Upcoming Lessons
- Problems in the U.S. healthcare system will be discussed.
- Exploration of the role of an interoperable informatics landscape in solving these problems.

This introductory lesson sets the stage for a deeper exploration into the U.S. healthcare system and the critical role that Health Informatics can play in its improvement, with a special focus on data interoperability.
