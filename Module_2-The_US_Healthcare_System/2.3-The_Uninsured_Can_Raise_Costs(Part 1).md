## 2.3 - The Uninsured Can Raise Costs (Part 1)

### Introduction: The Global Perspective on Health Insurance
- Map observation: Except for the U.S., virtually all developed nations have universal health care.

### Affordable Care Act (ACA) & Its Limitations
- Major coverage provisions started in January 2014.
- Significant gains in coverage but...
- Estimates as of the end of 2016: ~30 million Americans still uninsured.
> **Note:** "Significant coverage gains, but still a long way to go."

### The Institute of Medicine (IOM)
- Health care arm of the National Academy of Science.
- Founded in 1863 under President Lincoln.

### IOM's Observations on Uninsured Individuals
- The uninsured use less health care on average than insured persons and members of fully insured families.
- This "lost utilization" may be hidden but has costs:
  - Ill health
  - Disability
  - Premature death

This section underscores the pressing issue of uninsured Americans and how this not only affects those individuals but potentially inflates overall healthcare costs. It calls attention to the limitations of current policies like the Affordable Care Act and suggests that significant work remains to be done to achieve universal health coverage.
