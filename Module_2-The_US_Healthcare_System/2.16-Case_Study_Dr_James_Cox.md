## 2.16 - Case Study: Dr. James C. Cox Onsite at Emory University

### Introduction
- Dr. James C. Cox, Noah Langdale Jr. Chair in Economics, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar, and Director of the Experimental Economic Center at Georgia State University.
- Focuses on experimental and behavioral economics in healthcare.

### The Role of Economics in Healthcare
- Economists can bring insights into how people respond to incentives and use information in decision-making.
- Design mechanisms to improve decision-making, especially for healthcare providers.

### Problem Identification
- The problem is not a lack of information, but how to use the overwhelming amount of it.
- Role of Dr. Cox's team is to analyze large datasets to identify predictors of successful and unsuccessful hospital discharges.

### Solution: Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)
- Data analysis by economists and IT staff designs an original Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS).
- Experiments conducted with resident physicians and fourth-year medical students.
- Initial experiments involved virtual patients based on real patient data, later moved to standardized patient actors.

### Challenges: Real-time Interaction with EHR
- The need for a CDSS version that can interact with electronic health records in real-time.
- Encountered obstacles with Cerner Corporation and Emory IT due to concerns about patient information protection.

### Breakthrough: FHIR Compliance
- Introduction to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards as a path forward for integrating CDSS with EHR.
- Cooperation from class teams at Emory led to alternative, user-friendly information displays for the CDSS.

### Key Features of the CDSS
- Two major requirements for CDSS value:
    1. Correct predictions about the probability of readmission.
    2. User-friendly information display.
- The display shows variables in the patientâ€™s record including labs, vitals, all color-coded to indicate their marginal significance on the probability of readmission.

### Conclusion and Future Directions
- Critical for the tool to not just make correct predictions but also to present information in an easily digestible format for physicians.
- Focus on moving from the lab to real-world patient wards for testing and implementation.

> These lecture notes summarize Dr. James C. Cox's exploration into leveraging economics and data analytics to enhance healthcare decision-making through a Clinical Decision Support System.
