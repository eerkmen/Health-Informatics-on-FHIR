### Dr. Karen Bell's Viewpoint

### Seven Key Business Processes in ACOs
Dr. Bell states that ACOs must implement seven business processes, all of which depend on Health Informatics:
1. Care Coordination
2. Cohort Management
3. Patient Relationship Management
4. Clinician Engagement
5. Financial Management
6. Reporting
7. Knowledge Management

### Four Primary Requirements of ACO HIT Infrastructure
To support these processes, ACOs need a robust Health IT Infrastructure with the following attributes:
1. Ability to share health information among various internal and external providers, patients, and caregivers.
2. Data Integration from clinical, administrative, financial, and patient-derived sources.
3. Attention to HIT functions that support patient safety.
4. Strong Privacy and Security Protections
