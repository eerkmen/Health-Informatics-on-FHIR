## 2.12 - The Role of Health Informatics in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)

### Introduction
Exploring how Health Informatics plays a crucial role in the success of models like Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).

### Dr. Karen Bell's Viewpoint
- Chair of the **Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT)**
- Published a post in June 2013 on the Health Affairs blog

### Seven Key Business Processes in ACOs
Dr. Bell states that ACOs must implement seven business processes, all of which depend on Health Informatics:
1. Care Coordination
2. Cohort Management
3. Patient Relationship Management
4. Clinician Engagement
5. Financial Management
6. Reporting
7. Knowledge Management

### Four Primary Requirements of ACO HIT Infrastructure
To support these processes, ACOs need a robust Health IT Infrastructure with the following attributes:
1. Ability to share health information among various internal and external providers, patients, and caregivers.
2. Data Integration from clinical, administrative, financial, and patient-derived sources.
3. Attention to HIT functions that support patient safety.
4. Strong Privacy and Security Protections

### Current State of Healthcare Organizations
- "Most healthcare organizations have a lot of work to do in order to achieve all of this."

### Challenges and Future Prospects
Dr. Bellâ€™s quote: "The promise of Accountable Care is tempered by a dearth of experience with care process redesign and culture change, and of knowledge about the health information technology infrastructure necessary to optimally support healthcare transformation."

### Summary
- The need for Health IT in supporting new care and payment models like ACOs is clear.
- We still have a long way to go to develop and properly use these systems.

> The lecture highlights the essential role Health Informatics plays in establishing and running effective ACOs. Dr. Karen Bell outlines the processes and requirements critical to the HIT infrastructure supporting ACOs, emphasizing the journey ahead for healthcare organizations.
