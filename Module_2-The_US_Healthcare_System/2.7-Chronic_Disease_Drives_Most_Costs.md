## 2.7 Chronic Disease Drives Most Costs

### Introduction
The US healthcare system excels in providing high-technology care but falls short in quality, efficiency, and safety, particularly for treating chronic diseases. 
A 2004 paper in public health reports that I strongly recommend you read:

### The Crisis of Chronic Diseases
- **Key Statistics**:
  - In 2000, approximately 125 million Americans (45% of the population) had chronic conditions.
  - 61 million (21% of the population) had multiple chronic conditions.
  - **Projected Increase**: The number of people with chronic conditions will steadily rise over the next 30 years.

> **Quote**:
> "While current health care financing and delivery systems were designed primarily to treat acute conditions, 78% of health spending is devoted to people with chronic conditions."

### The Need for Systematic Changes
- Quality medical care for people with chronic conditions requires a new orientation:
  - Prevention of chronic disease
  - Ongoing care management

> **Specific Focus**:
> "Specific focus should be applied to people with multiple chronic conditions."

### Fragmentation in Healthcare Services
- **Average Medicare Beneficiary**: Sees between six and seven different physicians.
- **Beneficiaries with 5+ chronic conditions**:
  - See almost 14 different physicians in a year
  - Have an average of 37 physician visits annually
  - Fill almost 50 prescriptions in a year
