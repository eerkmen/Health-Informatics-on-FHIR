## 2.13 - Toward a Learning Healthcare System

### Introduction
Discussion of Health Informatics in improving not just care delivery, but ensuring the "right care for every patient, every time."

### Role of Academy of Medicine
- Previously known as the **Institute of Medicine (IOM)**
- Recognizes the challenges and opportunities in this new era of medical science
- Concerned with personalized health care and complex choices for both physicians and patients

### The Learning Healthcare System: A Definition
The Academy of Medicine describes a Learning Healthcare System as:
- "A sustainable system that gets the right care for people when they need it and then captures the results for further improvement."

### Necessity for a Feedback Cycle
1. **Gather Data**: From care that has already been delivered.
2. **Aggregate Data**: Pooling the data together.
3. **Analyze Data**: Learning from the collective results of multiple care instances.

### Summary
- The Academy of Medicine emphasizes the importance of transforming healthcare into a Learning Healthcare System. This model aims to assist physicians and patients in making increasingly complex decisions by utilizing Health Informatics for continuous learning and improvement.

> This lecture note emphasizes the transition towards a system that doesnâ€™t just focus on immediate care but is engaged in a cycle of constant learning and improvement to ensure the efficacy and efficiency of healthcare services.
