## 2.11 - Alternate Care Models: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)

### Introduction
Exploring the challenge of recreating the success of large organizations like Kaiser Permanente on a smaller scale with pre-existing community health resources.

### Traditional Healthcare Payment Model
- Known as **Pay for Procedures**
- Charges based on the amount of care delivered

### HMOs as an Alternate Model
- Operates on **Fixed Reimbursement**
- **Example**: Kaiser Permanente
    - Makes a profit if it spends less than its premium income
    - Relies on owning hospitals and employing physicians

### Can This Scale Down?
- **Question**: Can we create a similar model on a smaller scale with existing resources?

### Introduction of the Term "Accountable Care Organizations"
- Term first used by Dartmouth Professor Elliott S. Fisher in 2006
- **Aim**: To improve quality and lower the cost of care

### Basic Concept of ACOs
- "A financial model under which existing community providers can organize and deliver care in a way that improves the quality and lowers the cost of care by fostering greater accountability on the part of the providers for their performance."

### Policy Support for ACOs
- Key provision in the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act
- Now widely advocated by commercial health insurance companies
